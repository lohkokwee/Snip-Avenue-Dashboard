# Snip Avenue Dashboard

We created this interactive dashboard as a proof of concept for Snip Avenue as part of our <i>IS215: Digital Business Transformation and Technologies</i> project. The goal is to demonstrate the ability of dashboards and how they could allow key stakeholders to tap on live information to inculcate a data-driven culture within the organisation.

# Development
The folders for our dashboard are organised in the following manner.

1. [Apps](./apps) - this is where you can access the different views for our streamlit web dashboard
2. [Components](./components) - this is where we store the code for our data visualisations and common methods
3. [Assets](./assets) - this is where we store our datasets and images
4. [notebooks](./notebooks) - this is where our working notebooks are stored (note that the code is very raw as it consists of our workings)
